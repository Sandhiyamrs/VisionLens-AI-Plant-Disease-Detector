🌿 VisionLens — AI Plant Disease Detector












🌱 Project Overview

VisionLens is an AI-powered web application that detects plant leaf diseases using deep learning and provides confidence scores and cure suggestions in real time.

🔍 Why Plant Disease Detection Matters

Early detection prevents large-scale crop loss

Helps farmers take timely action

Improves agricultural productivity

Reduces dependency on manual inspection

🧠 How It Works

User uploads a plant leaf image

Image is processed using a TensorFlow deep learning model

The model predicts the disease with a confidence score

The app displays disease name, accuracy, and treatment suggestions
