# 🌿 VisionLens — AI Plant Disease Detector

## 🌱 Project Overview

VisionLens is an AI-powered web application that detects plant leaf diseases using deep learning and provides confidence scores and cure suggestions in real time.

---

## 🔍 Why Plant Disease Detection Matters

1.Early detection prevents large-scale crop loss

2.Helps farmers take timely action

3.Improves agricultural productivity

4.Reduces dependency on manual inspection

---

## 🧠 How It Works

-User uploads a plant leaf image

-Image is processed using a TensorFlow deep learning model

-The model predicts the disease with a confidence score

-The app displays disease name, accuracy, and treatment suggestions
