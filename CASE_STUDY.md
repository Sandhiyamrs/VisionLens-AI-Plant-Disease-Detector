# 🌿 VisionLens — AI Plant Disease Detector  
## 📌 Case Study

---

## ⭐ 1. Problem

Farmers and gardeners often struggle with:

- Identifying plant diseases early  
- Lack of access to experts  
- Misdiagnosis due to similar-looking symptoms  
- No quick digital solution for real-time disease detection  

Plant diseases reduce crop yield, affect productivity, and create financial loss.  
A fast, accessible, AI-powered solution was needed.

---

## ⭐ 2. Solution

I built **VisionLens**, an AI-driven plant disease detection web application that allows users to:

- 📤 Upload plant leaf images  
- 🤖 Detect diseases using a trained TensorFlow model  
- 📊 View confidence scores  
- 💊 Get actionable cure suggestions  
- 🌐 Use a fast, responsive UI built with Next.js + Tailwind  

The app runs directly in the browser and uses Vercel Serverless Functions for instant inference.

---

## ⭐ 3. Outcome

✔ High-accuracy plant disease classification  
✔ Real-time predictions (TensorFlow.js inference)  
✔ Clean and responsive Next.js UI  
✔ Actionable suggestions for each detected disease  
✔ Live deployed version on Vercel  
✔ Smooth scanning experience with image preview  

This project demonstrates strengths in:

- Deep learning model integration  
- Next.js full-stack development  
- Responsive UI/UX  
- Practical AI application for agriculture

## ⭐ 4. Tech Stack

### 🚀 Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  

### 🧠 AI / Backend
- TensorFlow / TensorFlow.js  
- Vercel Serverless Functions  

### 🛠 Tools
- GitHub  
- Vercel Hosting  
- npm  

---

## ⭐ 5. Techniques Used

VisionLens uses:

- Custom-trained plant disease classification model  
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)  
- Softmax confidence score interpretation  
- Serverless inference for low latency  
- Next.js Client + Server Components architecture  

---

## ⭐ 6. App Flow (How It Works)

**Upload Leaf Image → Run TF Model → Detect Disease → Display Confidence + Cure Tips**

🔹 User uploads or takes a picture of a leaf  
🔹 Image is preprocessed and fed into the TensorFlow model  
🔹 The model predicts the disease  
🔹 The app displays:  
   - Disease name  
   - Confidence percentage  
   - Cure/solution suggestions
